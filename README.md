-This repository contains implementations of Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithms for classification tasks.

-Both algorithms are fundamental to machine learning and are widely used for various purposes like text classification, spam detection, sentiment analysis, and more.

Features:-

- Naive Bayes Classification- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Gaussian Naive Bayes

- SVM Classification- Linear SVM
- Kernel-based SVM (RBF, Polynomial, etc.)
- 
🟡 Naïve Bayes: The Probabilistic Predictor

- Approach: Uses Bayes’ theorem with the assumption that features are 
- independent.
- Strengths: Works great with text classification, spam filtering, and problems where probability plays a major role.
- Speed: Lightning-fast with large datasets! 🏎️
- Types: Gaussian (continuous data), Multinomial (text data), Bernoulli (binary features).
- Weakness: Assumes feature independence, which may not always hold true.
- 
🔴 Support Vector Machine (SVM): The Hyperplane Hero

- Approach: Finds an optimal decision boundary (hyperplane) to separate classes.
- Strengths: Excellent in high-dimensional spaces and works well for complex classification problems.
- Speed: Slower on big datasets, but highly accurate when tuned properly. ⚡
- Kernel Tricks: Linear, Polynomial, Radial Basis Function (RBF), and Sigmoid—handles non-linearity like a champ!
- Weakness: Can be computationally expensive and sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters.
