-This repository contains implementations of Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithms for classification tasks.

-Both algorithms are fundamental to machine learning and are widely used for various purposes like text classification, spam detection, sentiment analysis, and more.

Features:-
- Naive Bayes Classification- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Gaussian Naive Bayes

- SVM Classification- Linear SVM
- Kernel-based SVM (RBF, Polynomial, etc.)
